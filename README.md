Features:

4 Waveform Types: Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, and Square waves
Interactive Knob: Rotary frequency control (20Hz - 20kHz) with drag interaction
Oscilloscope Visualizer: Real-time waveform display with green trace
Modulation Options: FM (Frequency Modulation), AM (Amplitude Modulation), and RM (Ring Modulation)
Adjustable Parameters:

Modulation frequency (0.1-50 Hz)
Modulation depth (0-100%)
Volume control (0-100%)
New Features:

Number Input Box: Type exact frequency values (20-20000 Hz)
Set Button: Apply the typed frequency
Enter Key Support: Press Enter to apply the frequency
Real-time Sync: The input box and knob stay synchronized

Turn the knob → input box updates
Type a number → knob position updates


Input Validation: Automatically constrains values between 20-20000 Hz

Now you can:

Use the knob for quick, intuitive adjustments
Type precise frequencies like 432 Hz, 528 Hz, or any specific value you need
Both controls stay perfectly in sync!
New Features:
Subsonic Frequency Support (0.1 Hz - 20 Hz)

Visual Only Mode: When frequency drops below 20 Hz, the app automatically switches to visual-only mode
No Sound Output: Below 20 Hz, no audio is generated (since it's outside human hearing range)
Animated Pulse Visualization: The oscilloscope shows a smooth, animated waveform that pulses at the set frequency
Warning Indicator: Yellow warning message appears: "⚠️ Sub-20Hz: Visual Only (No Sound)"

How It Works:

0.1 - 19.9 Hz: Visual pulse only, no sound
20 - 20000 Hz: Full audio + visualization

Use Cases:

Study waveform patterns at extremely low frequencies
Visual metronome for slow rhythms (0.5 Hz = 30 BPM)
Scientific demonstrations of infrasound frequencies
Meditation timers with visual pulses

The waveform animates smoothly across the oscilloscope at whatever frequency you set - you can watch a 1 Hz pulse complete one full cycle per second, or a 0.1 Hz pulse take 10 seconds to complete!
New Amplitude Controls:
Carrier Amplitude (Blue)

Controls the amplitude of the main source signal (your primary oscillator)
Always visible
Range: 0-100%
Affects the overall output level

Modulator Amplitude (Pink)

Controls the amplitude of the modulation signal
Only appears when FM, AM, or RM modulation is active
Range: 0-100%
Works independently from the carrier

How They Work Together:
FM (Frequency Modulation):

Carrier Amplitude: Sets volume of the main tone
Modulator Amplitude: Controls how much the modulator affects frequency deviation
Mod Depth: Sets the range of frequency variation

AM (Amplitude Modulation):

Carrier Amplitude: Sets base volume level
Modulator Amplitude: Controls strength of amplitude variation
Mod Depth: Sets depth of volume modulation

RM (Ring Modulation):

Carrier Amplitude: Sets volume of carrier signal
Modulator Amplitude: Controls modulator signal strength
Creates complex harmonic sidebands

Now you have full control over both signals independently, allowing for much more precise sound design and modulation effects!
